How does Obsidian help connect thoughts? \u00b6 Obsidian uses the feature of [[Backlinks]] . You don't know what they are? Try clicking the Purple text. What Next? \u00b6 Now let's Learn some simple Obsidian Commands Obsidian Commands \u00b6 Headings \u00b6 Headings in Obsidian can be written by using # the more amount of hashes you use the smaller the heading will be. [[Examples]] Also be sure to leave a space after the Hash Backlinks \u00b6 To make backlinks type and the name of the page you want to create a backlink to. More commands will appear on the screen after you type the brackets. Emphasize \u00b6 To emphasize texts in your writing use the following commands Italics \u00b6 Start and end your sentence or word with a single asterisk( * ) or underscore ( _ ) or use CTRL + I Italics Bold \u00b6 Start and end your sentence or word with double asterisk( * ) or underscore ( _ ) or use CTRL + B Bold Strikethrough \u00b6 use double tildes(~) for this Strikethrough Highlight \u00b6 Use double equals sign(=) Highlight Horizontal Line \u00b6 use *** or --- or ___ Creating Lists \u00b6 Bulleted List \u00b6 These can be created by using {-(space)'list item'} and nesting - will give u a nested list example:- item1 item 2 item 3 item 4 Numbered List \u00b6 These can be created by using {1.'list item'} and can also be nested example:- Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item nest 1 Item nest 2 Inserting Images \u00b6 Just insert Images from your pc. These can be resized by inserting resolution values in the file command after adding a |. ![[Dying Light 2 Stay Human Screenshot 2022.08.17 - 00.09.24.70.png|675]] Referring to Links \u00b6 This can be done by adding a name by using [] followed by () in which u write the link Example:- Obsidian Quote Blocks \u00b6 use > to enter quote blocks You cannot understand Quantum Mechanics you can only do Quantum Mechanics. - David J. Griffiths \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\alpha \\sin{}\\) [! Note] A \\ can be used to cancel out the effect of any command example:- A - will give us a list but when we use \\- it would only appear as a dash Writing Codes in Obsidian \u00b6 Anything written between `` will be considered code and triple bacticks like ``` can be used to write a code block. Your preffered language can be written after the first 3 backticks to change the highlighting pattern based on the language. Indenting with 'Tab' key can also be used to write a code block. Example:- The code to print \"Hello, world\" in Python is print(\"Hello, world\") and the code to print the addition of 2 numbers is as follows. a = 5 b = 6 print(a+b) This is a Tab indented code block Task Lists \u00b6 List of Tasks can be created by using a - and writng a x in square brackets [] like this -[x] Example:- Task 1 Task 2 Table \u00b6 Tables can be created by separating each column with a | and a line of hyphens - to separate header from cells example :- In code Example First Header | Second Header --------------|----------- This is cell 1 | This is cell 2 This is Cell 3 | This is cell 4 Output Example First Header Second Header This is cell 1 This is cell 2 This is Cell 3 This is cell 4 Tables can also be justified by using colons (:) Example(view source code):- TIME SEPTEMBER 19 SEPTEMBER 20 SEPTEMBER 21 09:00 - 10:00 PHY201 MTH201 BIO201 16:00 - 17:00 CHM201 IDC Using Advanced Tables Plugin \u00b6 Type | then First heading and press Tab to enter next cell and press Enter to enter next row. Also Shift + Tab can be used to go to the previous cell. Footnotes \u00b6 Footnotes can be added like this. You need to write [^text(without gaps)] and then in the end specify the value of each footnote by writing it's value after writing [^Text of the footnote you are referring]\\: and then write what is the value of the footnote by first giving a space after the colon. This is a foot note! 1 Here is another footnote 2 For inline footnotes write it directly after a sentence and use the carat(^) before the square brackets This is an inline footnote ^[Hello I am a footnote] Comments \u00b6 These are texts that will only show in the source mode and not in the reading mode. %%This is a comment%% %% This is a comment block %% Callouts \u00b6 Callouts can be written by using a > followed by [!(Text for callout) ] then you can write multiple links within the callout and it also supports markdown and link embeds [!First Callout] First Callout here is some Markdown Math \u00b6 Math can be written in Obsidian like Latex using Mathjax. Inline equations can be written like this $E=MC^2$ Output- \\(E=mc^2\\) Display equations can be written like this $$\\int e^x.dx$$ Output - $$ \\int^b_a e^x.dx$$ Further Reading for Mathjax - Mathjax Website Diagram \u00b6 These can be created using a language called mermaid.
